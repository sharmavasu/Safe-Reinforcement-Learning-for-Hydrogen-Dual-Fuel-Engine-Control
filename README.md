# Safe Reinforcement Learning for Hydrogen Dual-Fuel Engine Control
This repository presents safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) for real-time control of a Hydrogen Diesel Dual-Fuel (H2DF) engine. The work presents a novel end-to-end deep learning approach that combines offline plant modeling with online learning to achieve precise engine control.
